# Stylistic-Patterns-and-Readability
Growing IT complexity and related problems, which are reflected in IT tickets, create a need for new qualitative approaches. The goal is to automate the extraction of main topics described in tickets in order to provide high quality support for the IT process workers and enable a smooth service delivery to the end user. Present paper proposes a method of knowledge extraction in a form of stylistic patterns in business process (BP) texts, here in incoming IT tickets texts. Hereby, the authors set an objective to predict their readability and perceived complexity for a process worker, what will influence further tasks execution. The results of experimental analysis of a data set of incoming ticket texts from an ITIL-based Change Management process showed that the specificity of stylistic patterns expressing the readability of a ticket and perceived complexity could be identified with the help of proposed measures of the ticket length, parts-of-speech distributions and wording style.
